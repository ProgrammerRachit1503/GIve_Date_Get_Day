This is the code I and my cousin wrote to test our Logical Reasoning skill and coding skill.

This code just tell you what day of the week is on a certain date. 

For Example take March 15th, 2004 is on a Monday, 

But how would you know without googling or go in calendar of your phone or PC and  scearching up!!
Instead of this just type date date in MM/DD/YYYY format and you will get the day!!

2 versions currently, 1 in python and 1 in java
